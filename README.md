# LoanTracker
Part one in an attempt to create an application to allow me to see the long term vs. short effects of differnt amortization shcedules to develop a repayment plan which focues on overall effectiveness and sensible limits to additonal amount paid each month.

For this part I just wanted to be able to read the details of each loan from a text file and store it in a collection object. For this first one I chose a Hash Map since I could use the indivudal loan numbers as the key to the value of a loan object containing the rest of the details.

Next I want to create a simple web app which connects to a database so there will be a UI to allow the user to perform CRUD operations on the loan and payment details.
